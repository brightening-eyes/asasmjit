asasmjit
------------------------------

a jit compiler for AngelScript using
[asmjit](http://github.com/asmjit/asmjit)

note:
------------------------
this code is based on
[angeljit](https://github.com/feliwir/angeljit/)
i'm working on it at least for my project, but i've plased this here, because i'm using the newest asmjit version
this code is modified to work with the next branch of asmjit, and i'm planning to make it complete (it is somehow incomplete)
